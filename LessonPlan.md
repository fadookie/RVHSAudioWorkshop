# RVHS Unity Audio Workshop Lesson Plan

## Part 1
- how to search freesound and download samples
- briefly cover copyleft attribution guidelines to ensure license compliance
- 3D audio crash course, attach emitters to the player and the fountain to demo positional audio
- audacity crash course to trim a sample of [jump sounds](https://freesound.org/people/dynamique/sounds/554738/?) into discrete samples
- load up the starter project with my modifications. I can include a starter and finished version of the project. Try to cover the following audio implementation tasks;
- randomization crash course. If we are using unity 2023.2+ we can use the built-in [AudioRandomContainer](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AudioRandomContainer.html). If we're on an older version we can code these things manually.
  - integrate the jump sounds into the player controller
  - sample, pitch, volume randomization for jump sound

## Part 2
- How to search ccMixter and Incompetech to get royalty free music
- crash course on [Chiptone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone) to synthesize the energy shield sound
- integrate the shield sound into the player controller 
- music playlist with shuffle
- unity mixer / bus volume control for making in-game volume settings
